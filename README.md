# Album-App

Album App is a simple photo gallery application built with React.js. It allows users to add, edit, and delete albums using a fake online REST API (JSONPlaceholder) for demonstration purposes.

## Features

1. **View Albums**: Displays a list of existing albums with their titles and user IDs.
2. **Add Album**: Allows users to create a new album by providing a title and user ID.
3. **Edit Album**: Enables users to update the title and user ID of an existing album.
4. **Delete Album**: Allows users to delete an album from the list.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Styling the components and layout of the app.
- JSONPlaceholder: A fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.
